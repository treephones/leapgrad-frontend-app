## Summary

A quick React app for the LeapGrad Frontend Developer Challenge. Homepage dynamically loads calls from the API, and displays them from most recent to least, grouping them by date. Incoming calls are denoted by the green arrow phone icon, and outgoing with the red arrow phone icon. Caller ID's in red represent missed or ignored phone calls.

When a call is clicked, a modal appears, providing additional information about the call, along with the option to archive it. Archived calls can be viewed via the button in the top right on the activity feed. All archived calls will appear here, rather than on the activity feed.
